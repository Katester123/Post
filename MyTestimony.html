<h1>My Testimony</h1> <hr />
<p> Hi my name is Katelyn and I’m going to tell you a little about my Savior and how he has worked in my life. <br> <br>
For those of you who do not know about our Savior, He is an amazing God who watches over each one of us throughout our entire life. He guides us when we are lost and heals us when we are hurt. He goes by many names- God, Jesus, Christ, the Great I Am, Yahweh, and the Trinity.<br><br>
I accepted Christ in June of 2005. It was a month before my fifth birthday. I was at VBS (Vacation Bible School) at my grandparents church. My twin sister, Mikayla, and our cousin, McKenna, who is our age all decided that year that we wanted to accept Christ into our hearts and get baptized together. This was the very first step into the beginning of my walk with Jesus.<br><br>
Throughout the majority of my childhood, I was surround in a Christian atmosphere at home and in the outside world. I had gone to a private Christian school for three years where we were taught stories from the Bible and strengthened our relationship with God, but when I entered the fifth grade I was moved to a public school due to my dad getting a new job and us moving.  When I entered this new school it was a completely different atmosphere. There were people who hadn’t grown up in a Christian atmosphere and didn’t believe in God. People had began to confront me about my faith. They would ask me questions about why I believed in Christ and how I know he is real. I told them I believed in God because he has done so many miraculous things for my family and I. He has kept my family strong and healthy and is always there whenever we need Him. He is a God who always listens to you and never leaves you no matter what. Growing up and continuing to grow through my teenage years,  I have experienced what every girl goes through these years and that is the fear that that you will miss out on fun events with your friends because your parents said no. Well I can say through experience that God gives you your parents for a reason and has them say certain things for a purpose. Throughout multiple times in my life God has walked me through difficult times like this. Like most teens, I had wanted to go out with my friends but my parents said no. This ended up being a good thing. It turned out that God was protecting me by not letting me go because that day my friends had hydroplaned and crashed their car. They were all alright in the end but it was a reminder that all things happen for a reason and that God truly does look out for me. As I continue to grow in my faith, I always look back on this as a reminder that God has my best interests at heart. My parents didn’t know that my friends were going to crash but something told them not to let me go out that day and I truly believe that that was God telling them that something bad was going to happen and to keep me home.<br><br>
I thank God everyday for giving me such an amazing family and for watching out for all of us. I choose to honor Him by living out His will for me and spreading His word to those who do not fully know him. I encourage each of you who have read my testimony to remember this and the next time you think “why was I told no” or “why did this happen to me” to think instead “what is God planning for me and how can I better from this” instead of dwelling in what you couldn’t have or do.<br><br>
Down below I have shared a few of my favorite verses and quotes. I hope you enjoy them and can learn from them!<br>
